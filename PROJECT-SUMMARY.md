## How to Play
1. Start the game with `npm run dev:all`
2. Choose single player or multiplayer mode
3. Use WASD keys to control your dragon
4. Eat leaves to grow longer and increase your score
5. Level up every 5 points to make your dragon move faster
6. At higher levels (11, 21, 31, etc.), additional leaves will appear for more scoring opportunities
7. Avoid colliding with yourself or other players
8. Watch the level progress bar to see how close you are to the next level
9. Check the speed indicator to see how fast your dragon is moving
10. Compete for the highest score and level!
